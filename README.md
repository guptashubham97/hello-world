Starting out
Hello Hoomans 
If you are reading this I really hope your family is safe amidst this pandemic.
I know that key to success is not talent or education and definetly not luck.
I believe it is perseverence. If you are a baller you ougt to ball till you fall and then ball again. 
Nothing comes easy for people like us who never tasted that life that they wished for and it makes them dark and relentless.
And I am pretty sure that is where our strenght lies 
But that darkness that is instilled makes going bad feel like a treat and when you look back you realize all that carnage left behind in your pursuit of "a better life" is something that will haunt you. 
One has to bury his friends and move ahead cut lies and look through lies. Will I ever be naive like I was?
I was not like this I was kind and credulous.
But the pursuit of success which I unknowlingly admitted as my life made me a person who is not what he was. 
I sometimes miss the old me and sometimes, well I will say more than sometimes this tradeoff seems like a bad deal. But I have to grow up and this world is not so pure for an innocent to continue being innocuous.
